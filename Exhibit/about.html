<h1>About</h1>
</div>

<p>The dire issue in the world today is arguably climate change. As a man-made phenomenon, climate change is the periodic alteration of temperature, weather, and climate system. Although Earth's climate has the tendency to shift within a period of time, its increment is rather alarming on account of the speed of change, and is caused by an array of factors from burning fossil fuels to deforestation. This is evidence that an effort to shift ways of life, such as incorporating green framework developments, understanding climate change, and approaches to promote climate policies are not only necessary for the scientists and policymakers, but needs to also be taken on by everyone on Earth.
</p>
<p>Human activity has affected the Earth greatly over the past couple of decades. Change in weather, climate, water bodies and other systems across the globe is fundamentally the need and fuel to push action on climate change. The term climate change is commonly used as a synonym to global warming, however it designates long-term shifts in temperature and includes natural phenomenons, such as floods, cyclones and heat-waves. Since the dawn of the industrial era, the temperature of Earth has skyrocketed at a continuous degree per century due to emission of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning, methane, and nitrous oxide.
</p>
<p>The combustion of coal, oil, and gas for energy, extensive farming, and deforestation all contribute greatly to these activities. Consequently, the mean global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1°C since the nineteenth century, and while that might not seem like much, the impact on ecosystems, sea levels, and weather patterns is profound. This increase alone makes the world undergo climate change.  
</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why climate change is a global issue. The first change to identify is disrupting the natural order. Biodiversity ceases to exist and is heavily impacted as warmer temperatures rise. Like, for example, the eastern side of the continent where hemiboreal forests have shifted to cooler regions of the desert of higher latitudes causing the species to go extinct. They cannot adapt quickly enough. As for the GBR, dying coral reefs are being caused by greater ocean temperature and CO₂ acidification.  
</p>
<p>The second reason is directly affecting the health of mankind, and their ability to make a living. Extreme weather episodes, both hot and cold, lead to floods and increase droughts, seizing agri-economy. As like in Australia, Greek and Californian fires are becoming too intense to control. Unstable temperature leads to unstable agricultural growth which in turn leads to increase in famine.  
</p>
<p>Coastal communities also face the rising threat of higher sea levels due to melting glaciers and polar ice caps.Islands and places such as New York and Jakarta are at a risk of flood-related displacement. Migration for climatic reasons is becoming more common today because people are being forced to relocate from their homes due to changes making them uninhabitable. 
</p>
<p>The consequences of climate change also pose a threat to infrastructure. Newer nations are more vulnerable to infrastructure-damaging extreme weather, struggling with resource scarcity and systemic underdevelopment. And these are the regions contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. 
</p>
<p>While much stress is laid on proactive climate mitigation measures, raising awareness is just as important of a first step. Understanding how climate change changes so many dynamics, from air quality and food supply chains to water availability, highlights the urgency to treat it as a current issue that needs immediate attention. 
</p>
<p>Being knowledgeable of climate change allows people to make more candid and reasoned decisions. From means of inefficient energy consumption to diet, adopting a more supple and sustainable lifestyle translates to lowering one's personal carbon footprint.More informed citizens are likely to elect and support leaders and policies that take proactive measures in areas such as climate mitigation, emissions reduction, and environmental concern.
</p>
<p>Education also aids in the elimination of untruths. Denial of climate change fuels political disputes, but science confirms the reality of climate change is overwhelmingly supported, given its human origin. The public's grasp of concepts plays a pivotal role in denialism, making it essential to design effective change strategies.
</p>
<p>I chose 8 artists for this exhibit and they each contribute to educating others about climate change. I chose Chakaia Booker because she is a black woman of color and I can relate to how she views life. I can see myself in her in the way she works with what she has and creates masterpieces, it’s inspiring. I chose Ansel Adams because he is a beautiful photographer. I like the way most of his photoshoots are of landscapes because I love nature and looking at the scenery. He captures them so well it’s nostalgic, I’m reminded of my highschool photography class.
</p>
<p>I chose Robert Havell because I think it’s interesting how even in the 1800s people were still creating art about climate change. It has been a problem for so long and there have been many advocates for change but the government continues to ignore it. I also like how beautiful he paints the animals. I chose Olafur Eliasson because even though he’s old he is still an activist against climate change and for changing our unhealthy habits with our planet. I’ve also seen his piece in SFMOMA many times and I love that a local is advocating for change.
</p>
<p>I chose Tan Zi Xi because she is from out of the country. I also relate to this artist a lot because we majored in similar things with hers being graphic design and mine being DMA and we both strive for a career illustrating. We also both have a parent or two that is an artist which greatly influenced us to pursue it. I chose Ana Teresa Fernandez because I love her point of view on life. She talks about the intersectionality of place, person, and politics which I like because I think people often overlook how much identity and politics intersect. She is also Mexican like me and is from the bay like me! I relate to this artist a lot.
</p>
<p>I chose Tapas Das because I like how he expresses his mind and thoughts through his artwork. I like how most of his paintings have metaphorical meanings. I also like his Indian style of painting. I chose Su Yu because I like the way most of his paintings have double meanings and are collage-like while still being a painting. I relate to his motivation and drive like creating art till our hands sweat. I love the way he tells stories with his paintings.
