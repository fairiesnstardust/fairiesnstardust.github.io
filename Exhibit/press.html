<p>This spring, Naila Castillo-Harrell presents an exhibition about climate change. She put together 8 different artists from different times and places to talk about this important problem that needs to be addressed right away. Featuring Chakaia Booker, Ansel Adams, Robert Havell, Olafur Eliasson, Tan Zi Xi, Ana Teresa Fernández, Tapas Das, and Su Yu, this immersive show moves through past, present, and speculative futures, reflecting on our planet’s transformation and fragility.
</p>
<p>Working across generations and geographies, these artists render the climate crisis visible—at times visceral, elegiac, and unflinching. Their works do not merely illustrate catastrophe, but provoke embodied awareness and ask viewers to reckon with entanglement, complicity, and hope.
</p>
<p>Chakaia Booker’s monumental tire sculptures command space with their coiled intensity. Sourced from discarded rubber—material saturated with histories of labor, travel, and waste—her works confront industrial excess and its racialized and ecological consequences. The twisted forms suggest resilience and adaptation in the face of entropy.
</p>
<p>In dialogue with Booker’s materials of entropy, Ansel Adams’ The Tetons and the Snake River (1942) anchors the exhibition’s historical axis. This celebrated landscape photograph, once a symbol of American purity, is recontextualized here as a fragile monument to lost time. Its meditative composition contrasts the instability of the current environmental moment.
</p>
<p>Robert Havell’s Snowy Owl, a 19th-century engraving after Audubon, serves as both artifact and harbinger. Positioned within a contemporary climate discourse, the owl’s presence—serene, spectral—becomes a chilling reminder of the rapid extinction facing Arctic fauna due to global warming and ecosystem collapse.
</p>
<p>Olafur Eliasson’s Ice Watch installation stages the drama of impermanence. Segments of glacial ice harvested from Greenland are placed within the gallery space, where they melt over the course of the exhibition. Visitors bear witness to the silent erosion of an entire world—a time-lapse of planetary trauma.</p>
<p>Tan Zi Xi’s immersive Plastic Ocean installation surrounds viewers with suspended waste collected from real bodies of water. By submerging the audience in this synthetic sea, the artist challenges perceptions of environmental responsibility and offers a stark sensory experience of marine pollution’s scale and intimacy.</p>
<p>Ana Teresa Fernández’s On the Horizon reimagines cartography through movement. Her sweeping blue fabric interventions, drifting across the gallery atrium, evoke the erasure of shorelines, the dislocation of communities, and the rising tide of climate refugees. These ephemeral borders float in the balance between nature and nationalism.</p>
<p>Tapas Das’s Returning Life transforms salvaged urban detritus into visions of quiet renewal. His mixed-media panels are dense with imagery of birds, vines, and creeping flora—emblems of ecological rebirth that thrive through concrete cracks, offering subtle defiance against environmental decay.</p>
<p>Su Yu’s Iceberg Melting is a painted meditation on impermanence. Rendered in delicate brushwork and a limited palette of whites, grays, and blues, the iceberg’s form dissolves before the viewer’s eye—a beautiful undoing, serene and catastrophic.</p>
<p>Melting Points offers no easy narratives. Instead, it invites viewers to dwell in precarity and possibility, in mourning and movement. The exhibition functions as both a requiem and a rallying cry—a space where art makes visible what is melting beneath our feet.
