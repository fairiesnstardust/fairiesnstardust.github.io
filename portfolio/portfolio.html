I'm from Oakland and recently moved to San Jose to attend San Jose State University. I mostly work in digital media and pencil, but have worked with ceramics and traditional collage making. Something that drives me to make art is this inherent instinct in me that came from my mom and dad who were both artists that makes me want to create art. I love expressing myself through art and learning more about myself through coping with hard times with doodles. Some concepts and ideas I like to play around with are mystical character traits, a lot of my original characters have some like elf or cow ears. I always loved the idea of being able to create my own original concept and portray it in a way that my audience is able to understand. This drives me to want to create fantasy worlds of my own that other people can experience and play through. I love when the experience becomes dreamy or fantasy-like. Some big inspirations for these worlds would be giant mushrooms, curly plants, and tiny villages. Something I hope viewers will take away from my work is how different the world can seem to different people and the different ways it can be reinterpreted into new things.</p>
